# sumcol

Firstie's Summons Collection - a collection of additional summon spells for Dungeon Siege.

This collection aims to provide more fun and useful options, esp. ranged summons for nature mages, and to experiment with unusual summons like stationaries & miniboss scrolls.


## Principles

Stats are based on numbers of similar original summoning spells. See below for details on balancing.\
For stationary & explosive summons, gold value, duration & mana cost are much lower.\
For miniboss summons, scrolls are used; gold value is much lower, duration & life is much higher.\
Required level is a few levels higher than the level where players typically first encounter the creature, except when existing spells provide a reasonable precedent.\
Assignment to Nature vs. Combat Magic is done based on the creature, roughly following the shaky logic of the original spells.


## Installation

If you use DSLOA, simply put the "Summons Collection.dsres" file into the DSLOA folder. It contains all summons.

*Alternatively,* pick from the partial .dsres files, which are split by functional type (standard / non-standard) and by DS version (vanilla / LoA).

If you use vanilla DS, use the partial .dsres files to only install the vanilla summons.

Spells are added to PContent, which means they appear in shops & drops with some probability.\
Note: unfortunately, scrolls are excluded from PContent, so they won't appear on original maps without mods. See my minimod scrolls-in-shops for a solution.

### Compatibility
- If you play with vanilla DS, use only the vanilla dsres - LoA summons will not work properly.
- This mod is compatible with Unlimited Summons, except for the explosive summon (Blazing Elemental) which can still only be summoned once at a time.

## Balancing

Gold Value: is based on a formula reconstructed from original:\
Required Level 0-30: gold value = 30 * 10^(required level / 10)\
Required Level 30+:  gold value = 30 * 10^(required level / 50 + 2.4)\
Melee summons get 20% discount; stationary summons & miniboss scrolls get 80% discount.

Duration: base duration for standard summons is 5 minutes.\
Stationary summons have 1 minute, because you'll have to re-summon them frequently anyway.\
Miniboss scrolls get a full 15 minutes, because they're single-use. Make sure to heal them!\
Bonus minutes are given for melee summons and for slow creatures, because these factors waste a bit of time.\
Further bonus/minus minutes are given to counter the damage & health/defense values a bit.

Level cap: the maximum level (from which on the summon doesn't get stronger anymore) is always the required level + 20.\
Most originals follow this scheme as well, with a few minor deviations. (The only really odd one out is Summon Clone, by the way, which improves all the way from level 15 to level 65.)

Alterations: All summons use the same alteration formulas to make balancing simple & comprehensible.\
Damage: based on caster's level, with slight variation corresponding to the creature's properties. (Factors 0.9 and 1.1 applied for min and max damage respectively.)\
Only slight variation here with factors between 0.8 and 1.2 because damage affects XP balancing! Miniboss scrolls get an additional +0.2 damage factor on top of that of their base creature.\
Defense & Health: based on caster's level, with variations corresponding to the creature's properties. Miniboss scrolls get 3x the health of their base creature.\
Level (melee/ranged/CM): based on caster's level, with a dip around level 50, to match the strength of original summons. (Since LoA, creature level is part of damage calculations.)\
Strength/Dexterity/Intelligence: based on caster's level.\
Mana: based on caster's level.
