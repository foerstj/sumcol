# sumcol
Firstie's Summons Collection - a collection of additional summon spells for Dungeon Siege.

Stats are based on numbers of similar original summoning spells.\
For stationary summons, gold value, duration & mana cost are much lower.\
For miniboss summons, scrolls are used; gold value is much lower & duration is much higher.\
All spells are Nature Magic because they deserve more love!

## Installation
Put the "Summons Collection.dsres" file into the DSLOA (or Resources) folder.\
Alternatively, pick from the partial .dsres files, which are split by creature type (animals / elementals...) or functional type (standard / stationary / miniboss) or by DS version (vanilla / LoA).\
Spells are added to PContent, which means they should appear in shops & drops with some probability. Note: unfortunately, scrolls are excluded from PContent, so they won't appear.
