# sumcol
Firstie's Summons Collection - a collection of additional summon spells for Dungeon Siege.

Stats are based on numbers of similar original summoning spells.\
For stationary summons, gold value, duration & mana cost are much lower.\
All spells are Nature Magic because they deserve more love!

## Installation
Put the "Summons Collection.dsres" file into the DSLOA (or Resources) folder.\
Alternatively, pick from the partial .dsres files, which are split by creature type.\
Spells are added to PContent, which means they should appear in shops & drops with some probability.

## Features:
- Animals
  - Phraks: Phrak, Phrak Piercer
  - Spiders: Yellow Spider
  - Stationary:
    - Skrubbs: Farm Skrubb
